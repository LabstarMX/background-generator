				HEALTH COMMUNICATION AND ITS IMPORTANCE/WHY IS SBCC IMPORTANTIN EMERGENCIESDuring disease outbreaks and emergencies, specific actions are required of affected communities for prevention, containment and control. Communities need to be informed, motivated and equipped to practice the necessary protective behaviors, and this can be achieved through effective SBCC programming. Social and behavior change communication plays a critical role in addressing all the behavioral and social aspects of disease prevention and control. In particular, SBCC can: (a) Provide accurate, clear, relevant and timely information to the public on how to contain the emergency and protect themselves, (b) Identify and address myths and misconceptions that may lead to detrimental practices, (c) Maintain public trust, (d) Prepare communities for emergency response actions, (e) Reassure the public, (f) Support Communities and countries to recover and rebuild themselves after an emergencylf an emergency response does not include strategically applied communication activities, it is unlikely to succeed as desired. This is demonstrated by the tragic Ebola virus outbreak in West Africa in 2014, when lack of adequate and appropriate communication early on in the response fueled fear, panic and denial; spread misconceptions and rumors; and contributed to the further spread of the disease.SBCC has therefore been acknowledged as a key element of any crisis or emergency preparedness plan, and should be integrated in all stages of an emergency response from prevention and preparedness through to crisis response and recovery.Key areas in which the emergency communication pillar may intervene include: (a)Coordination, (b) Community mobilization and action, (c) Message development and dissemination (d) Capacity development, (e) Monitoring and evaluation (M&E)
